This project is about product analysis - a dataset of over 1,000 products listed on Amazon and building a recommendation system for these products.

My target is to understand customer preferences, identify purchasing patterns, and develop a recommendation system to suggest products to users based on their interests. 

My project will include the following steps:

**1. Data collection:**

The dataset I will be using has information on over 1000 products sold by Amazon, like their names, categories, prices, ratings, and reviews. I'm going to dig into this data and figure out what it all means, and how we can use it to help Amazon and its customers.

For Amazon, analyzing this data can help them understand which products are popular and which aren't, and they can use that information to figure out how to price and market things better. For customers, having access to this data can help them decide what to buy - if they see that a product has good ratings and lots of positive reviews, they'll be more likely to buy it. 

Features of Dataset:

product_id - Product ID

product_name - Name of the Product

category - Category of the Product

discounted_price - Discounted Price of the Product

actual_price - Actual Price of the Product

discount_percentage - Percentage of Discount for the Product

rating - Rating of the Product

rating_count - Number of people who voted for the Amazon rating

about_product - Description About the Product

user_id - ID of the user who wrote a review for the Product

user_name - Name of the user who wrote a review for the Product

review_id - ID of the user review

review_title - Short review

review_content - Long review

img_link - Image Link of the Product

product_link - Official Website Link of the Product

**2. Data preparation:**

Before we dive into the data analysis and visualization, we need to make sure our dataset is clean and properly formatted. 

- Data Inspection: I will start by inspecting the dataset to see if there are any missing values, duplicates, or inconsistent data. I will also check if the data types are correct and make sure the dataset is ready for analysis.
- Data Cleaning: Next, I will clean the dataset by removing or correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or irrelevant information. This will make the dataset more reliable and accurate.
- Data Transformation: After cleaning the dataset, I may need to transform the data to make it more useful for analysis. This can include scaling, normalization, or feature engineering.
- Data Saving: Once I've prepared the data, I will save it in a new file to avoid overwriting the original dataset. This way, we can always go back to the original dataset if we need to.

By following these steps, we can ensure that our data is clean, accurate, and ready for analysis!

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Visualization:**
In this stage, I will take a closer look at our data to understand how our products are distributed across categories, what the customer ratings look like, and what customers are saying in their reviews.

- Analyze the distribution of products by category using a bar plot.
- Analyze the distribution of customer ratings using a histogram.
- Analyze the reviews by creating word clouds or frequency tables of the most common words used in the reviews.
- Perform statistical analysis to identify any correlations between different features, such as the relationship between product price and customer rating.

**4. Simple recommendation system:**

I will develop a recommendation system using machine learning algorithms to suggest products to users based on their interests and previous purchases.
